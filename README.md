# Blackjack in Angular 2.0
#### by Dragos Lascu Â© December 2016

This blackjack game is my first Angular 2.0 project. Click for [live demo](https://uxal.github.io) on github page.
Please keep in mind that if you don't start the app with the default route and you start with "/game" or "/lobby" because of the github page hosting you'll get a 404 error.
On the local server it works fine!

This game supports up to 4 players but it can be easily extended to an unlimited number of players. At the beginning each player sets his/hers bankroll.
When clicking play the route changes and the main game room component is loaded. Here each player must select a betting value. Clicking multiple times on the chips increases the bet.
If player has less than 20 or 10 in wallet, 10 and 20 chips are disabled. The smallest 5 chip is never disabled but if you have only 3 USD left and click on the 5 chip, obviously you'll bet only 3 USD.
When you're out of money you can't play. You can hit "back to lobby" and add more money.

When a round begins, each player receives 2 cards and the dealer only one. If from the start a player has 21 ("natural blackjack"), that player will not see the action buttons to request a new card or to stand.
The dealer starts the automatic play after all the players have finished their moves either by standing, exceeding 21 or having 21.
The dealer requests a new card until it exceeds the highest valid points of a player.
After the dealer finishes winners and losers are declared. If a player has a natural blackjack the payout is 3:2.

Things to improve:
* The validation for player's bankroll, as you'll see it starts in invalid mode until you type something
* Add unit testing
* Improve the AI of the dealer. Currently it asks for a card until his points are above the highest points of a player.
